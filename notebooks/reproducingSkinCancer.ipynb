    "# Skin Cancer Classification using Inception Network and Transfer Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series of notebooks, we aim to reproduce the results of [Skin Cancer Classification using Inception Network and Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.02402v1). The paper explores the application of advanced neural network architectures, specifically Inception Networks, in conjunction with transfer learning techniques for skin cancer classification. Our objective is to rigorously validate the findings of the paper, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in our approach. Additionally, we will investigate and mitigate potential sources of data leakage within the dataset. Data leakage can lead to overly optimistic results by inadvertently incorporating information from the validation or test sets into the training process. By identifying and addressing these issues, we aim to demonstrate how such leakage can impact model performance and interpretation of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🏆 Objectives of this notebooks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Identify the specific claims related to classification accuracy, generalization across different skin lesion types, and the efficacy of the proposed methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Assess the methodology, dataset (HAM_10000), and the problem statement presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Define specific experiments needed to validate each identified claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Obtain the HAM_10000 dataset and perform data cleaning and preprocessing steps as mentioned in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Choose the same or similar models used in the paper for skin cancer classification and train the models using the preprocessed data and evaluate them using the same metrics reported in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Compare the results obtained from your reproduced models with the results reported in the original paper and analyze any differences or discrepancies in performance and identify potential reasons for variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  Identify potential sources of data leakage within the HAM_10000 dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  Re-train models after mitigating identified data leakage sources and compare performance metrics before and after leakage removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔍 In this notebook, we will:** 1. Identify the specific claims. 2. Define specific experiments. 3. Obtain the HAM_10000 dataset and perform data preprocessing. 4. Use the same model used in the paper for skin cancer using the preprocessed data. 5. Compare the results obtained from your reproduced models with the original paper’s results. —\n",
    "\n",
    "**🗣️ Claims :**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The model achieved a validation accuracy of 73.4% after the first training phase and 78.9% after the second training phase.\n",
    "2.  The results showed that the model could classify six out of seven categories with a true positive rate higher than 75%, even for classes with limited samples.\n",
    "3.  The entire training process required less than 20 GB of RAM and was completed in under four hours using a Google Colab GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🧪Experiment from the paper:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Images are loaded and resized from 450×600 to 299×299 in order to be correctly processed by the network. After a normalization step on RGB arrays, we split the dataset into a training and validation set with 80:20 ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In order to re-balance the dataset, we chose to shrink the amount of images for each class to an equal maximum dimension of 450 samples. This significant decrease of available images is then mitigated by applying a step of data augmentation. Training set expansion is made by altering images with small transformations to reproduce some variations, such as horizontal flips, vertical flips, translations, rotations and shearing transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We decided to take advantage of transfer learning, utilizing `Inception-ResNet-v2` pre-trained on ImageNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The original `Inception-ResNet-v2` architecture has a stem block consisting of the concatenation of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, while Inception-ResNet blocks (A, B and C) contain a set of convolutional filters with an average pooling layer. *This structure has been extended with a final module consisting of a flattening step, two fully-connected layers of 64 units each, and the softmax classifier.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this work we used a stochastic gradient descent optimizer (SGD), with learning rate set to 0.0006 and usage of momentum and Nesterov Accelerated Gradient in order to adapt updates to the slope of the loss function (categorical cross entropy) and speed up the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The total number of epochs was set to 100, using a small batch size of 10. A maximum patience of 15 epochs was set to the early stopping callback in order to mitigate the overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In order to improve classification performance, specially on minority classes, we loaded the best model obtained in the first round to extend the training phase and explore other potential local minimum points of the loss function, by using an additional amount of 20 epochs."
