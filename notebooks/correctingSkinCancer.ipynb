        "The HAM_10000 dataset is a widely used dataset for dermatological image classification, containing thousands of images of pigmented lesions. While it has been a valuable resource for training machine learning models, recent studies have highlighted significant issues with data leakage due to duplicate images within the dataset. This data leakage can lead to overly optimistic performance estimates and undermine the validity of research findings \\[2\\].\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we tackle the data leakage problem in the HAM_10000 dataset by addressing the duplicates within the dataset. Notably, insights from the survey paper “Leakage and the Reproducibility Crisis in ML-based Science” highlighted the issue of data leakage and its detrimental effects on reproducibility in machine learning. This survey also references the study “Investigating the Quality of DermaMNIST and Fitzpatrick17k Dermatological Image Datasets,” which provided evidence of duplicate images in dermatological datasets, including `HAM_10000`\\[1\\].\n",
        "\n",
        "Our approach involves two main notebooks: the first reproduces the original paper, and the second focuses on identifying and addressing data leakage in the HAM_10000 dataset. By showing image similarity and identifying duplicates, we will clean the validation dataset and subsequently evaluate the impact on model accuracy and confusion metrics.\n",

This discrepancy highlights a significant issue : the presence of near-duplicate images in datasets can artificially inflate performance metrics, leading to misleading conclusions about a model’s efficacy. This has implications on the reproducibility and reliability of published research. Papers that report inflated performance metrics due to such data issues may set unrealistic benchmarks, making it difficult for subsequent researchers to replicate results or make fair comparisons. To ensure the integrity and credibility of machine learning research, it is crucial to rigorously check for and address near-duplicates and other forms of data leakage before publishing results."
